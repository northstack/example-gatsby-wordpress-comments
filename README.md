# WordPress Comments Example for Gatsby Frontends

This is a bare minimum example of how to enable comment submission and dynamic display of comments on a Gatsby frontend that uses a headless WordPress site as a source.

**Note:** Once again, this is a bare minimum example. It's not intended to run as a production-ready site. Use this at your own risk.
